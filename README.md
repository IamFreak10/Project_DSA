 The ChatroLeague Chase: NSI Operatives & Dijkstra's Algorithm

 Mission Brief

The NSI Operatives are on a mission to capture the elusive ChatroLeague Leader. They must determine the shortest path between locations where intelligence has indicated the leader's presence. Using Dijkstra's Algorithm, the operatives will efficiently navigate the network of locations to close in on their target.

 How It Works

 Graph Representation
- Each location is represented as a node.
- Paths between locations are represented as edges with weights (distances).

Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm Implementation
- The algorithm finds the shortest path from the starting location to all other locations.
- Priority is given to paths with the least cost (shortest distance).
- The algorithm runs until the ChatroLeague Leader's last known location is reached.
